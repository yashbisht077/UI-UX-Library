## 📄 Documentation

The library includes a detailed documentation file explaining:

- ✅ **Why GRID GURU?**  
  Traditional frameworks are bulky or hard to customize. GRID GURU solves this with:
  - A clean 12-column grid system
  - Reusable UI components (navbar, buttons, cards, modals)
  - Utility classes for spacing, alignment, color, typography, and more
  - Dark mode support with a simple toggle class

- 🧰 **Modular CSS Files**  
  Include only what you need. Improve load times and keep your codebase clean.

- 📱 **Mobile-First Design**  
  Every component is built with responsiveness in mind.

- 🛠 **Easy Integration**  
  Just add a `<link>` to the required CSS file and you're good to go.
